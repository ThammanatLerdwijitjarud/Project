Are You Ready to Adopt a Dog?
If you are thinking about adopting a dog, but aren't quite sure about making such a big decision, consider these questions before you take the plunge:

1. What do you want a dog to contribute to your life?
   -> Do you prefer going on hikes or daily runs, or are you more likely to spend time lounging around the house?
      Do you want a snuggle buddy, or a pet who's independent?

2. Is your current house or apartment suitable for a dog?
   -> Is there space for a pet to play, eat, and go outdoors? What parts of the home will the dog be able to access?

3. How will your career obligations, social life, or vacations impact your ability to care for a dog?
   -> Do you have the time to give them plenty of attention? Do you have other care options for when you are away?

4. How will the people you live with react to your new dog?
   -> Do you need a dog who's friendly with children? Is anyone in the house allergic to dogs?

5. Are you committed to the dog, no matter the financial cost? Are you prepared to pay for food, toys, grooming, and vet bills?
