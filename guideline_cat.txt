Before deciding to adopt our cat, we want you to read this information about cat.
The adoption process starts with research and self-evaluation to ensure that you and your family are ready to welcome a cat into your lives.

Some of the questions you should ask yourself are:

1. Are you really ready to welcome a pet into your life?
    -> You should first think through why you are considering adoption – is it because you think the cat / kitten is cute, 
       or you’re thinking of it as a gift, or are you truly ready to commit to the cat for its lifetime?
    -> A cat can live for up to 20 years with proper quality nutrition and regular vet care. You should project forward for the next 20 years.
       Think about factors such as financial stability and major life changes, such as moving overseas for study/work, marriage, children, moving out of your home, etc.

2. Are you aware of the financial costs associated with a single cat?
